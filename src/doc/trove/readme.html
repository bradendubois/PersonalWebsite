    <p>This section will be a list of (hopefully daily!) coding problems I solve, and detail my approach for.</p>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>My initial motivation has been to practice for the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest" target="_blank">ACM</a> coming up.
        My classmates (and dear friends) and I formed a team of 3, and won the local qualifier at the University in the Advanced category.
        To prepare for the next competition, I thought it prudent to practice similar kinds of problems, every day.
    </p>
    <p>This seems to be a great way to keep skills sharp, however, so I plan to try to do this nearly daily, when my schedule permits.</p>
